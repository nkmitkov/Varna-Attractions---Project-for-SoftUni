# JavaScript project with React + Vite

Varna Attractions is my project for the Frond-end Framework course at SoftUni. It's focused on showing my knowledge of React. The HTML and CSS I took from here - https://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page281/traveler and change it a little bit to fit my idea. The server I use is made and given by SoftUni. The whole project must show that I understand how React works and that I'm able to use props, states, hooks, callbacks, forms, routing, authentication, route guards, etc.
