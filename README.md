# JavaScript project with React + Vite

Varna Attractions is a Single Page Application (SPA) showcasing the must-see attractions in Varna for every tourist. This project is part of my Front-end Framework course at SoftUni, highlighting my proficiency in React. Through this project, I demonstrate my ability to use props, states, hooks, callbacks, forms, routing, authentication, route guards, and more.

The HTML and CSS templates were adapted from https://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page281/traveler to better suit my vision for the application. The REST API, provided by SoftUni, allows me to illustrate my understanding of all CRUD operations via HTTP requests and responses.
